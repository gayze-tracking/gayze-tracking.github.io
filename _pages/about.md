My name is Jordan (he/him) and I'm a first-year PhD student in Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon advised by [Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com) :)

Before CMU, I graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I worked with [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) in the [Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of critical social computing, identity, and marginalized communities (particularly LGBTQ+ and fat communities).

I'm also interested in the methodological challenges of marginalized community research, such as selection bias introduced by social stigma. How do we avoid centering the least marginalized voices in a marginalized community?

**Research Interests**: Social Computing, Identity, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Social Science, Marginalized Communities, Feminism, Queer Theory, Fat Studies, Anonymity & Self-Disclosure

**Methods**: Human-Centered Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Interviews, Participant Observation, Participatory Design, and Mixed Methods

**Ongoing Work:**
1. LGBTQ+ Identity Work
1. Experiences of [fat people](https://medium.com/@thefatshadow/a-draft-agenda-for-fat-justice-db878d93cd98) in online communities

**Hobbies**: Running, Hiking, Vegetarian Cooking, and Punk Music
