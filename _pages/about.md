My name is Jordan (he/him) and I'm a first-year PhD student in Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon :)

Before CMU, I graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I worked with [Dr. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) in the [Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of critical social computing, identity, knowledge construction and marginalized communities (particularly queer and fat communities).

I'm also interested in the politics of methods: which forms of knowledge production do different audiences value, and how can that inform method selection for effective advocacy?

**Research Interests**: Social Computing, Identity, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Social Science, Marginalized Communities, LGBTQ+ Communities, Fat Studies, Anonymity & Self-Disclosure

**Methods**: Human-Centered Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Interviews, Digital Ethnography and Participatory Design

**Ongoing work:**
1. Characterizing GBQ information seeking practices in online communities
2. [Fat justice](https://medium.com/@thefatshadow/a-draft-agenda-for-fat-justice-db878d93cd98) in online communities

**Hobbies**: Running, Hiking, Vegetarian Cooking, and Punk Music
