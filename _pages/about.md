I'm a masters student in computer science at Georgia Tech advised by [Dr. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) and I recently applied to PhD programs :)

My research interests lie at the intersection of social computing and marginalized communities. In particular, I'm passionate about supporting the queer community and those living with stigmatized mental illnesses, such as substance use disorder. My current research involves using online communities to characterize opioid misuse experiences.

<!-- Themes:
1. **Public Health:** Applying quantitative methods to online communities to understand the experiences of people with marginalized and stigmatized identities to inform public health decision making
1. **Identity:** Understanding the impact of social computing systems on identity development, norm formation, and intracommunity marginalization both online and offline
1. **Design Justice:** Centering marginalized groups within the LGBTQ+ community to advocate for changes to existing queer social computing systems and to design new ones -->

Prior to my masters, I received a BS in computer science from Georgia Tech concentrating on theoretical computer science and AI. My hobbies include running, vegetarian cooking, \[dance \| folk \| post\] punk music, and complaining about Grindr at both the amateur and professional level.

**Research Interests**: Social Computing, Wellbeing, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Social Science, Marginalized Communities, LGBTQ+ Communities, Intracommunity Marginalization, Anonymity & Self-Disclosure 

**Methods**: Human-Centered Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science
