I'm a Masters student in computer science at Georgia Tech advised by [Dr. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/). Prior to my masters, I received a B.S. in computer science from Georgia Tech concentrating on theoretical computer science and AI. 

In the fall, I'm starting my HCI PhD at Carnegie Mellon!

My research interests lie at the intersection of social computing and marginalized communities. In particular, I'm passionate about supporting the queer community. 

<!-- Themes:
1. **Public Health:** Applying quantitative methods to online communities to understand the experiences of people with marginalized and stigmatized identities to inform public health decision making
1. **Identity:** Understanding the impact of social computing systems on identity development, norm formation, and intracommunity marginalization both online and offline
1. **Design Justice:** Centering marginalized groups within the LGBTQ+ community to advocate for changes to existing queer social computing systems and to design new ones -->



**Research Interests**: Social Computing, Wellbeing, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Social Science, Marginalized Communities, LGBTQ+ Communities, Fat Studies, Anonymity & Self-Disclosure 

**Methods**: Human-Centered Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Interviewing, and Participatory Design

**Ongoing work:**
1. Using online communities to characterize opioid misuse experiences
2. Characterizing LGBTQ+ information seeking practices on Reddit
3. [Fat justice](https://medium.com/@thefatshadow/a-draft-agenda-for-fat-justice-db878d93cd98) in online communities
4. Housing justice in Atlanta

**Hobbies**: Running, Hiking, Vegetarian Cooking, and Punk Music
